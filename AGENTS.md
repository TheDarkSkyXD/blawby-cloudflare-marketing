Blawby's primary audience is lawyers and legal staff who are not technical. Write like Stripe docs — clear, confident, assumes the reader is smart but not a developer. If you're explaining a feature, explain WHY it matters to a law firm first, then HOW to use it. Never lead with technical details.

## What Blawby is

A legal payment and practice management platform. IOLTA-compliant payments, client intake automation, invoicing, and AI chat. Lawyers use it to get paid faster and spend less time on admin.

## Tone

Clear, respectful, direct. Never condescending. Lawyers are intelligent professionals — treat them as such. Avoid legal jargon and tech jargon equally.

## 🔗 Internal Linking & CTAs

### Linking Rules

- Use absolute internal paths (e.g., `/blog/how-to-delegate`)
- Link only to deeply relevant content
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Include at least two internal links in each post

### CTA Guidelines

Every article must end with a CTA that feels like a natural resolution.

- **Blog Posts:** Soft pitch tied to the pain discussed.
  - _Example:_ "Let Blawby handle payments—so you can focus on building your practice. [Register for Blawby](https://ai.blawby.com/register)"
- **Guides/Lessons:** Clear next steps.
  - _Example:_ "Next step: [Send your first invoice](/features/send-invoice)"

## 🧱 Technical & MDX Rules

### Content Management

- Drop an MDX file in `src/data/solutions/{category}/` or `src/data/lessons/`
- No manual registration needed
- Required frontmatter: see `src/data/_template.mdx`
- Valid categories: `guides`, `payments`, `ai-intake`, `compliance`, `ai-chat`, `business-strategy`

### Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: "Descriptive Title"
metaTitle: "SEO Optimized Title | Blawby"
desc: "Meta description for SEO"
author: "Paul Chris Luke"
category: "compliance" # Must match folder name
contentType: "article" # article | lesson
order: 10 # Controls sidebar sorting (lower = higher)
createdAt: "MM/DD/YYYY"
updatedAt: "MM/DD/YYYY"
tags:
  - payments
  - iolta
keywords:
  - law firm payment processing
faq:
  - question: "Question?"
    answer: "Answer."
noindex: false
---
```

### Image Requirements

- Use Next.js `<Image>` component
- Always include width and height
- Example: `![Alt text|1000x500](/path/to/image.png)`

### Capturing Product Screenshots

Need real product screenshots for documentation? See [`SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md`](./SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on:

- Starting the local dev environment
- Logging into the test practice
- Capturing screenshots from each product feature
- Replacing `<DocPlaceholder>` components with real images

The guide includes routes, conventions, and automation patterns using Playwright.

### Accuracy

- Never invent pricing, feature capabilities, or compliance claims
- If unsure whether a feature exists, describe the problem it solves without claiming Blawby does it
- IOLTA compliance claims must be accurate — this is a legal requirement, not marketing copy

### 🚫 Do Not

- Add entries to `articles.ts` or `lessons.ts` manually
- Mention or compare us to competitors like LawPay or Clio
- Use custom React components in MDX (including CTA, Callout, FAQ) unless explicitly allowed

## Lighthouse CI

Lighthouse runs against Cloudflare Pages preview URLs which automatically inject `x-robots-tag: noindex`. The `is-crawlable` audit is disabled in `.lighthouserc.json` for this reason — it would always fail on preview deploys. Production deployments at blawby.com are indexable and not affected by this.
